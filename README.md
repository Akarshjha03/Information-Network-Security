## 🔐 Cipher Implementations

**Caesar Cipher**  
A simple substitution cipher where each letter is shifted by a fixed number of positions.  
_Refer to **Cryptography and Network Security** by William Stallings for detailed theory._

**Monoalphabetic Cipher**  
A substitution cipher where each letter is replaced by another letter based on a fixed mapping.  
_See **Introduction to Modern Cryptography** by Jonathan Katz and Yehuda Lindell._

**Playfair Cipher**  
A digraph substitution cipher that encrypts pairs of letters.  
_Detailed in **Handbook of Applied Cryptography** by Alfred J. Menezes et al._

**Polyalphabetic Cipher**  
Uses multiple substitution alphabets to encrypt data.  
_Explore **The Code Book** by Simon Singh for historical context._

**Hill Cipher**  
A polygraphic substitution cipher based on linear algebra.  
_Refer to **Cryptography: Theory and Practice** by Douglas Stinson._

**Simple Transposition**  
Rearranges the plaintext characters based on a fixed pattern.  
_See Stallings’ book for more._

**One Time Pad**  
A perfectly secure cipher using a random key as long as the message.  
_Theoretical foundation in Shannon’s information theory._

**Diffie–Hellman Key Exchange**  
A method for securely exchanging cryptographic keys over a public channel.  
_Detailed in Menezes et al._

**RSA Algorithm**  
A public-key cryptosystem based on the difficulty of factoring large numbers.  
_Refer to **Applied Cryptography** by Bruce Schneier._
